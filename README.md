# Solidity_pro
This course was designed to introduce some basic concepts of Web3 and started with solidity programming.There have a module base learning method which are really effective.Now, for a submission, there is challenge to get all these things to work and the challenge is to make my own token.

## Description of Challenge

I have created a contract with tha name as mytoken in that i used string and uint variable : for strings  I gave a name as  token named "prath" abbreviated as "coin". There is the record of its total supply. And if someone mints some "prath" tokens then it will be added to the total supply of it. Also if someone burns those tokens, it will get subtracted from the total supply.

## Intro
I wrote the code in Solidity Language, and I used Metacrafters ETH Proof Course as my learning resource which helped me creating this project.

### Install

* I just used here the Online Remix IDE for implementation of  the solidity code with the version of (0.8.18).
* Then I created a file in this repository named mytoken1.sol it available in my github library.

### Execution Flow

* If you are using Remix IDE
* You can simply compile the code from the side menu.
* After compiling, you have to deploy the Contract from the side bar itself.
* And after deploying you have to enter certain inputs that the Smart Contract requires for minting and burning the tokens and also for checking the balance (all value shows down).

## Help

I suggest exploring the Metacrafters academy for similar valuable resources.
